# We should form a migration committee

I believe that it is time to migrate our community away from Slack,
and I want to form a committee to find out if this is a good idea,
and where we can migrate to.

## Contributing to this document

Because this is hosted on GitHub, we will use Issues and PRs to manage
this proposal. If you do not want to interact with the GitHub platform,
you may DM me (@sehqlr) with your request and I will create a PR for you.

## Timeline

I don't want to rush this process. I also believe that the initial stage
of gathering requirements should be the longest, because that will
allow people who aren't on this slack very often to have their ideas
considered. Therefore, I'm inclined to say that the initial requirements
gathering phase should last between one and three months.

# Why we should migrate from Slack

## Why Slack has been good for us

Slack has been a good solution up until recently because many people
use it at work and many other public instances exist

Reactjis are fun

## Why Slack is no longer good for us

Slack is not a good solution for our community because
1. poor moderation tools
2. no blocking/muting tools for individuals
3. Not everyone uses Slack at work/home
4. we cannot afford the license for all Slack features
5. our chat history disappears quickly

## Why we should committee

I know that committees are not the most fun thing, but because it
would be costly to migrate, I want to gather information about possible
alternatives to Slack and community preferences.

# Requirements

## Must-haves

Here are the initial requirements that I have for a migration. I'll keep
the list initially brief

### Allow Slack as a client

We started on Slack, and many people use Slack for work currently or in
the past. If we were to completely leave Slack, I believe many, many
people would not follow.

### Better Moderation Tools

I do not moderate at all, so I'll let others comment on specifics here

### Allow users to block each other

This will reduce harrassment and moderation interventions

## Nice-to-haves

Things that are soft requirements. I'm putting this here even though I
cannot think of anything at the moment
